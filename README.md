# React Turn Based Game Application

This project is a tutorial delivered by PortExe [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Z7R25spkE). I've completed this game tutorial to expand my knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS features, especially Hooks.

## Tutorial / Project Description

To build a one player turn based 'AI' game using ReactJS only.

**Brief:**

- Build a React game application that allows the user (Megaman)to play against an AI Opponent (Samus).
- Build on the basic application to learn more about developing React apps whilst learning about React Hooks and gameplay synchronicity.

**Desktop Version Only**

## Built with

This application was built using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development environment and JavaScript. I used Vite despite it not being used in the tutorial and only a couple of ESLint issues were encountered which were easily fixed using stack overflow. I inten to use Vite going forwards for React as I understand Create React App is dead!

## Packages Used

In addition to the the frameworks / libraries and tools mentioned above:

- ESLint: used to follow industry standard rules.

## Installation Instructions

- Clone this repo
  - e.g. `gitclone https://github.com/tonymm55/react-megaman.git`
- Change directory into the repo
  - e.g. `cd react-megaman` (or the directory you specified the repo to be cloned into)
- Install the dependencies from `package-lock.json`
  - `npm install`
- To start the app:
  - `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## If I Had More Time

- I would like to explore why the turns are not always synchronised. My React Hooks knowledge is not quite there yet and so it's an area for developement. I plan to develop my knowledge of React Hooks with several courses that I have identified including John Smilga, Codecademy and Scrimba's Bob Ziroll.
